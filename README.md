JavaScript Game Development 

https://www.udemy.com/javascript-game-development-create-your-own-breakout-game/learn/v4/overview 

Description
Take a step-by-step approach to learning how to build a complete JavaScript game. In this course we will cover the basic set up of the HTML and CSS pages and then we will dive right into coding our game! Starting from creating basic shapes on our canvas element to animating a ball, and then finally keeping track of the player's lives and score. We will cover many interesting topics, including:

HTML canvas element
for loops
arrays
objects
creating custom functions
mouse controls
And much more!

There are only two things that you need to take this course: an internet connection and a computer. There is no need to download any paid software or set up complex development environments.

The course is 1.5 hours long and is structured in a step-by-step manner, from simple to more difficult concepts. We build the JavaScript game from the ground up and cover each game component one at a time - so you will never feel overwhelmed with the content.
